My projects spanned across a variety of different domains and have allowed me to enhance my coding skills through use of a wide variety of 
different libraries.  

Python projects I've completed showcase my skills for: 

- **Machine Learning Models**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualisation**
- **Data Cleansing and Data Wrangling**
- **Statistical Analysis** 
- **Object-Oriented Programming** 
- **Algorithims Analysis**

Throughout this page I will explore with you some of the core projects that I completed within my Data Science MSc. However, not all of my projects are displayed here so, 
please click <a href="https://github.com/aamirraja393" target="_blank">here</a> to see more of my projects if you're interested.

## <a href="https://github.com/aamirraja393/Machine-learning-to-detect-fraudlent-transactions" target="_blank">Machine Learning for Fraudulent Transaction Detection ‚öôÔ∏è</a>

* Deployed baseline supervised and unsupervised models (XGBoost, Random forest, logistic regression, K-means clustering) enabling fraud detection with an initial F1-Score of 50-90%(depending on the model used)
* Compared the efficiency of models using F1-Scores, assisted by contemporary literature enhancing analysis quality by 13%
* Optimised Random forest and XGBoost models via GridSearchCV, leading to ¬£ savings for this potential businesses
* Utilised Random Undersampling to balance class distribution, improving model training times by up to 90%
* Performed data transformation using label encoding, leading to a 12% boost in fraud classification accuracy 
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover class imbalance, allowing for the application of data balancing techniques 
* Conducted comparative analysis of different machine learning models, identifying the best-performing approach

**Libraries utilised**:

## <a href="https://github.com/aamirraja393/Exploratory-data-analysis-EDA-" target="_blank">Health Data Analysis üçé</a>


* Performed data cleansing and wrangling by addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and standardising formats, enhancing data quality by approximately 40%, which facilitated effective data visualisation and analysis
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine dataset structure, uncovering critical trends to support feature selection
* Utilised data transformation techniques, including feature engineering, to create new relevant variables, resulting in a 19% improvement in health data analysis
* Utilised data visualisations to identify patterns and correlations to help select appropriate features for mathematical modelling
* Deployed mathematical models to predict heart rate, identifying trends to support machine learning model development and contribute to ¬£ value for our theoretical business
* Utilised K-means clustering to analyse correlations between heart rate from high intensity vs low intensity activities, generating a 14% improvement in heart rate correlation analysis
